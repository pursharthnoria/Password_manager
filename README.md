# Password_manager

This is a password manager. 

Usually you do not want to trust the websites for protecting your passwords.
Anyone can hack into your google account and see your saved passwords.

So what this project does is, it maintains a database where you can generate a 15 character password for a website you want.

The database will be protected with a master password to which no one has access to.

You can delete or generate as many passwords as you want.

Also, the password is encoded using SHA256 algorithm and therefore, no one can decode the password.
